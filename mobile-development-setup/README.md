# Mobile Development Setup with React Native, TypeScript, NativeWindCSS, and Expo

## Introduction

This repository serves as a guide to setting up a mobile development environment using React Native, TypeScript, NativeWindCSS, and the Expo framework. This stack allows developers to build high-quality, cross-platform mobile applications efficiently.

By following this guide, you'll be able to:

- Set up your development environment.
- Install and configure Expo for mobile development.
- Test your applications on real devices using Expo Go.

## Project Reset Observations

- The reset command cleared dependencies and removed caches.
- It restored the project to a clean state.
- I had to reinstall dependencies using `npm install`.
- My source files remained unchanged.
